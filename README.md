# README

This repository contains the report, code and video demonstrations for Team 18's project for the Image & Video Processing Course. The topic of our project us Video Stabilization.



### Data

This folder contains a sample unstable video titled *test.avi* that can be used to test the code on.

### Optical Flow

This folder contains a sample demonstration video that generates and displays Optical Flow.

### Stabilization

This folder contains the stabilized output videos generated by running the base algorithm and its variations on the unstable input video.

### base_stabilization.ipynb

This notebook contains code for the base stabilization algorithm implemented with a moving average filter

### catmull_rom_stabilization.ipynb

This notebook contains code that uses Catmull-Rom Splines, to obtain a smooth fit.

### derivative_poly_fit_stabilization.ipynb

This notebook contains the code final implemented code.

### derivative_stabilization.ipynb

This notebook contains code that implement a derivative fit on the transform.


### poly_stabilization.ipynb

This notebook contains the improved code that fits a high-degree polynomial to the trajectory to generate a smooth trajectory vector.
